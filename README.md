# CS201 - Data Structures & Algorithms: Projects

This is an archive of my projects for CS201 during Spring 2022. 

### On Duke's Community Standard

In accordance with Duke's community standard, students are not permitted to replicate code found on the internet. As such, students should not refer to this repo for help, that is a violation of Duke's policy - my answers are posted here as part of my portfolio, not to be reused by future CS201 students.
